# Working with the actual animations on Unity

Note: To use the animations with expression, LipSyncPro is required to be installed, ass described in the *Assets* section below

The steps required to get started with the project on Unity:

* ANIMATION FILE CREATED IN BLENDER SOFTWARE AS .FBX FILES ARE IMPORTED INTO UNITY PROJECT .
* ALL THE FBX FILES MUST BE CHANGED FROM GENRIC (DEFAULT) TO HUMANOID IN ANIMATION TYPE ,THIS MAKES THE ANIMATION ON ONE MODEL TO BE RETARGETTED TO DIFFERENT MODEL
* TO DO THAT:
  * UPLOAD/IMPORT THE FBX FILE INSIDE A FOLDER IN  PROJECT(TAB)
  * SELECT THE FBX FILE AND GO TO THE INSPECTOR(TAB)
  * SELECT RIG(TAB) UNDER INSPECTOR AND CHANGE THE ANIMATION TYPE TO HUMANOID  AND SELECT APPLY .

  * SELECT THE CHECK BOX FOR BAKE INTO POSE FOR ALL 3 ROOT TRANSFORM OPTIONS AND 
  * CHANGE THE ROOT MOTION NODE FROM <NONE> TO <ROOT TRANDSFORM> UNDER MOTION AS SHOWN IN THE BELOW PICTURE 
      
      ![Alt text](img/3.jpg?raw=true "3")
  * NOW SELECT THE ANIMATION FILE IN THE PROJECT(TAB) AND LEFT CLICK THE FILE AND DRAG AND DROP THE FILE INSIDE ANIMATOR(TAB) AND A NEW ANIMATION STATE WILL BE CREATE, WHICH WILL BE USED TO PLAY THE ANIMATION WHICH IS CONTROLLED BY THE ANIMATOR CONTROLLER
